      "[1]  What is JPEG?\n",
      "\n",
      "JPEG (pronounced \"jay-peg\") is a standardized image compression mechanism.\n",
      "JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the\n",
      "committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either\n",
      "full-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\n",
      "It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\n",
      "drawings.\n",
      "\n",
      "JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\n",
      "handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\n",
      "of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\n",
      "respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "JPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't\n",
      "quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\n",
      "of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\n",
      "the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details\n",
      "of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\n",
      "be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\n",
      "small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\n",
      "invisible to the eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\n",
      "adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\n",
      "off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\n",
      "files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\n",
      "archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\n",
      "aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\n",
      "can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "[2]  Why use JPEG?\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\n",
      "24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\n",
      "networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\n",
      "2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\n",
      "disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\n",
      "size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\n",
      "\n",
      "If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to\n",
      "convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\n",
      "with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\n",
      "than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\n",
      "JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\n",
      "store or transmit an image more cheaply.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\n",
      "time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\n",
      "extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\n",
      "posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\n",
      "(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\n",
      "only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\n",
      "to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\n",
      "black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\n",

      "[1]  What is JPEG?\n",
      "\n",
      "JPEG (pronounced \"jay-peg\") is a standardized image compression mechanism.\n",
      "JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the\n",
      "committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either\n",
      "full-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\n",
      "It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\n",
      "drawings.\n",
      "\n",
      "JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\n",
      "handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\n",
      "of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\n",
      "respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "JPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't\n",
      "quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\n",
      "of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\n",
      "the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details\n",
      "of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\n",
      "be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\n",
      "small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\n",
      "invisible to the eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\n",
      "adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\n",
      "off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\n",
      "files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\n",
      "archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\n",
      "aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\n",
      "can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "[2]  Why use JPEG?\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\n",
      "24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\n",
      "networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\n",
      "2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\n",
      "disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\n",
      "size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\n",
      "\n",
      "If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to\n",
      "convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\n",
      "with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\n",
      "than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\n",
      "JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\n",
      "store or transmit an image more cheaply.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\n",
      "time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\n",
      "extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\n",
      "posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\n",
      "(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\n",
      "only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\n",
      "to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\n",
      "black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\n",
      "in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\n",
      "people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\n",
      "more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\n",
      "\n",
      "JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\n",
      "GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\n",
      "things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\n",
      "gray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\n",
      "similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display\n",
      "hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\n",
      "\n",
      "GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\n",
      "such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\n",
      "that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\n",
      "by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\n",
      "introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\n",
      "(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\n",
      "should be avoided in JPEG files.)\n",
      "\n",
      "JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\n",
      "adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\n",
      "come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\n",
      "sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\n",
      "often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\n",
      "particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.\n",
      "If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\n",
      "scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\n",
      "subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\n",
      "The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\n",
      "\n",
      "Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\n",
      "You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\n",
      "images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\n",
      "of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\n",
      "should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\n",
      "(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\n",
      "applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\n",
      "a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\n",
      "can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\n",
      "converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.\n",
      "If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\n",
      "prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\n",

      "\n",
      "As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\n",
      "convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\n",
      "full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from\n",
      "that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\n",
      "here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\n",
      "loss of quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\n",
      "make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\n",
      "that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\n",
      "setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\n",
      "section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\n",
      "don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\n",
      "will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\n",
      "candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\n",
      "the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\n",
      "Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't\n",
      "expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\n",
      "directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\n",
      "to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\n",
      "JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\n",
      "not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\n",
      "\n",
      "Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\n",
      "border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\n",
      "storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\n",
      "border boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\n",
      "a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\n",
      "system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\n",
      "way to do this.)\n",
      "\n",
      "cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\n",
      "for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\n",
      "image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\n",
      "Q setting may not be necessary.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\n",
      "your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\n",
      "If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\n",
      "significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\n",
      "together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\n",
      "trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\n",
      "color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\n",
      "file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\n",
      "gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\n",
      "To get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\n",
      "Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\n",
      "you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\n",
      "color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\n",
      "often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\n",
      "the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\n",
      "than you'd get without smoothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\n",
      "capability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\n",
      "Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\n",
      "dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\n",
      "fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\n",
      "smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\n",
      "the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing\n",
      "wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\n",
      "pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is\n",
      "a LOT faster than pnmconvol...\n",
      "\n",
      "The upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\n",

      "First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than\n",

      "I pulled out a copy of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" that I had recorded off TV\n",

      "the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\n",
      "a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\n",
      "station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\n",
      "frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\n",
      "5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\n",
      "\n",
      "I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\n",
      "card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\n",
      "imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\n",
      "keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\n",
      "to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\n",
      "\"2.00\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\n",
      "frames.\n",

      "Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\n",
      "test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\n",
      "disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\n",
